# Installation and Usage of OpenBLAS for Matrix Multiplication

This README provides detailed instructions for downloading, installing, and using the OpenBLAS library for high-performance matrix multiplication operations in C programming.

## Overview

OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library based on GotoBLAS2, capable of accelerating linear algebra operations on many hardware platforms.

## Requirements

- GCC Compiler
- Basic knowledge of terminal operations

## Installation of OpenBLAS

1. **Download the Source Code:**  
   Download OpenBLAS from the GitHub repository. Replace `v0.3.29` with the latest version if necessary:
```bash
   wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.29.tar.gz
   tar -xzf v0.3.29.tar.gz
   cd OpenBLAS-0.3.29
```
2. **Compile and Install OpenBLAS:**
Compile and install OpenBLAS in the home directory:
```bash
make
make PREFIX=~/mylibs/openblas install
```
3. **Set Environment Variables:**
Update your shell environment to include the OpenBLAS library and include paths:
```bash
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/mylibs/openblas/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export CPATH=~/mylibs/openblas/include:$CPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
## Create a C file to execute the code
A C file is created in the home directory
```bash
nano openblas.c
```
## Compiling Programs Using OpenBLAS
Once OpenBLAS is installed, compile the C programs with the following command structure:
```bash
gcc openblas.c -o openblas -L~/mylibs/openblas/lib -lopenblas -lm 
```
## Running
Execute the compiled code with:
```bash
./openblas
```
## Output
The final output of the program will display the result of the matrix multiplication.

# System Information Gathering Guide

This README provides detailed instructions on how to gather system information on a Linux node in the Explorer Cluster using command-line tools.

## Overview
Understanding the specifications of a node in a cluster is crucial for tasks such as system maintenance, performance tuning, and software compatibility checks.

## Required Information
- **CPU Model**
- **Cache Memory Hierarchy**
- **Main Memory Size**
- **Operating System Version**
- **Associativity**

## Commands to Gather Information
Here are the commands you can use to gather each piece of information from a Linux node:

### a. CPU Model
To retrieve the CPU model:
```bash
lscpu | grep "Model name"
```

### b. Cache Memory Hierarchy
To get details about the cache memory including size and associativity:
```bash
lscpu | grep -i "cache"
```

### c. Main Memory Size
To determine the total amount of main memory:
```bash
echo "L1d cache size:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/size

echo "L1i cache size:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index1/size  

echo "L2 cache size:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/size  

echo "L3 cache size:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index3/size
```

### d. Linux Version
To find out the version of the Linux operating system installed:
```bash
cat /etc/os-release
uname -a
```
## e. associativity
To find out the associativty of the Linux operating system installed:
```bash
echo "L1d cache associativity:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/ways_of_associativity

echo "L1i cache associativity:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index1/ways_of_associativity

echo "L2 cache associativity:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/ways_of_associativity  

echo "L3 cache associativity:"
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index3/ways_of_associativity
```
## Usage
1. Open a terminal on the node.
2. Execute the commands listed above one at a time.
3. Record the outputs to document the system's configuration.

## Example Script
You can also create a simple shell script to automatically report all of the required information. Here's an example script:

```bash
echo "CPU Model:"
lscpu | grep "Model name"

echo "Cache Hierarchy:"
lscpu | grep -i "cache"

echo "Main Memory Size:"
free -h | grep "Mem"
cat /proc/meminfo | grep "MemTotal"

echo "Linux Version:"
cat /etc/os-release
uname -a
```

Save this script as `report_system_info.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x report_system_info.sh`, and run it by typing `./report_system_info.sh` in your terminal.

## Conclusion
This guide and the associated commands will help you quickly ascertain the key specifications of Linux nodes in your cluster, aiding in efficient system management and troubleshooting.

# Gray Code Row Ordering for Sparse and Dense Matrices

This repository contains the C++ implementation that sorts matrix rows based on their Gray code values for sparse rows and by column indices for dense rows. It's designed to optimize certain computational tasks by rearranging matrix rows according to the sparsity and ordering of columns.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you will need:
- A modern C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Code writing
first create a file gray_code.cpp which is the nested dissection C++ code using nano command
```bash
nano gray_code.cpp
```

## Compilation

Use the following command to compile the program with GCC or an equivalent compiler:
```bash
g++ -O2 -o gray_code gray_code.cpp
```

## Usage

Run the program by executing:
```bash
./gray_code
```

Input the number of rows and maximum column index, followed by the non-zero column indices for each row.

### Example Input
```
5 8
2 1 3
3 0 2 4
2 2 7
3 1 2 3
1 5
```

### Output
The output will display the ordering of rows based on the Gray code for sparse rows and first column index for dense rows:
```
Gray code ordering (threshold=20):
3 0 1 4 2
```

## Code Explanation

- The `toGrayCode` function converts an integer to its corresponding Gray code.
- The `main` function reads the matrix rows from the input, classifies them into sparse and dense based on a predefined threshold, sorts them, and then prints the final row ordering.
